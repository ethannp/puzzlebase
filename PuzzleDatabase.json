    "Tide Pool": {
      "From Hunt": "Hunt20",
      "Flavor Text": "Tide pools are a result of tides, as when the ocean goes backwards into the sea during a low tide, oftentimes pockets of seawater are left behind. \nLet's explore what lies between!",
      "Body": "a) Starfish can be found all over the ocean, from in the deep sea to near the surface in these tide pools. One common trait of the starfish is their ability to regenerate lost appendages, as long as the core of the starfish is intact. Some deep sea starfish, when given the right time, have an amazing, beautiful ability to emit light, called bioluminescence!\nb) Mussels often stay in groups, like warts, for protection against waves. They eat by sucking in water like a straw, which is full of free floating plankton and other microscopic organisms. \nc) Crabs are the cleanup crew of tide pools. When they’re hungry, they’ll eat almost anything; dead barnacles, small fish, dead plants, snails, or even other crabs can make for good desserts. Crabs use their claws to grab food and put it into their mouths. However, when stressed, crabs can be very skittish, and run away to hide under rocks or debris.\nd) Another common inhabitant of tide pools are sea snails. While they are called sea snails, they can also travel out of water as long as a wave wets the surface they climb, so they don’t dry out. Unfortunately, snails are prey to humans, who may cook them into escargot or a stew. \ne) Whenever the tide comes in and out, lots of new organisms get introduced to the tide pool ecosystem. With their feelers, anemone are able to reach out and collect plankton and other small organisms to eat, acting like a gateman with each incoming tide of plankton and organisms. They have so many feelers you’d think they need a nametag for each to keep track of them!\nf) Sea urchins are another common sight in tide pools, characterized by being covered in hundreds of spines. Surprisingly, they also have feet to move around and feed! They can’t move very fast however, so as predators draw near the urchin, sea urchins ward them off with their spikes.\ng) Occasionally, small fish can get trapped in tide pools as the tide recedes. These fish almost swam right into the hungry maws of the crab!\nh) Barnacles can get a bad rep: some people think they’re evil because they hurt when stepped on and can potentially live on almost any underwater surface, making sea turtles and whales look ugly and unhappy, or completely cover the bottom of a buoy or boat. However, they usually don’t harm whatever inhabitant they are on; they simply want to catch a ride. \ni) Plankton are the primary food source for any organisms living in tide pools with a hungry mood. Since plankton are microscopic, they are at the mercy of the currents. Thus, it spells certain doom for them when the currents take them into a tide pool of these ravenous creatures.\nj) While coral may seem like a plant, they are actually an animal! Corals are actually made up of thousands of little organisms called polyps. These polyps cover themselves in a mucus lamina, or layer, to protect themselves from the environment.",
